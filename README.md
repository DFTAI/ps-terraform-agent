# Docker

These Dockerfiles enable running PowerShell in a container for each Linux distribution we support.

This requires Docker 17.05 or newer.
It also expects you to be able to run Docker without `sudo`.
Please follow [Docker's official instructions][install] to install `docker` correctly.

[install]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

## Release

The release containers derive from the official distribution image,
such as `centos:7`, then install dependencies,
and finally install the PowerShell package.

These containers live at [hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell][docker-release].

At about 440 megabytes, they are decently minimal,
with their size being the sum of the base image (200 megabytes)
plus the uncompressed package (120 megabytes),
and about 120 megabytes of .NET Core and bootstrapping dependencies.
